## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Update Database Schema

Run the updated `supabase/schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy content from `supabase/schema.sql`
4. Run the query

### Step 2: Create Admin User

After signup, make yourself admin:

```sql
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('YOUR_USER_UUID', 'admin');
```

Get your UUID from: Supabase → Authentication → Users

### Step 3: Access Admin Panel
